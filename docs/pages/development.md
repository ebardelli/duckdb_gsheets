## Building

### Managing dependencies

DuckDB extensions use VCPKG for dependency management. Follow the [installation instructions](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started) or run:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
export VCPKG_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=`pwd`/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

### Build steps

To build the extension:

```sh
GEN=ninja make
```

The main binaries that will be built are:

- `./build/release/duckdb` — DuckDB shell with the extension auto-loaded
- `./build/release/test/unittest` — SQL test runner with the extension linked in
- `./build/release/extension/gsheets/gsheets.duckdb_extension` — loadable extension binary

## Running the extension

Start the shell with `./build/release/duckdb` and use the extension features directly.

## Testing

### Unit tests

Unit tests are standalone C++ tests that use a mock HTTP client — no credentials or network access needed:

```sh
make test_unit
```

### OAuth listener tests

`src/sheets/auth/oauth_listener.cpp` (the local HTTP listener used by the browser-based OAuth login flow) is built on `httplib::Server`, which pulls in DuckDB's re2 regex wrapper and Exception-formatting machinery - dependencies the standalone unit test target above deliberately avoids linking. Its tests live in `test/integration/` instead, built as part of the full extension build. No credentials or network access needed - it drives the real listener over real loopback TCP connections:

```sh
make test_oauth_listener
```

### COPY TO tests

`test/integration/test_copy_function.cpp` runs `COPY ... TO` through DuckDB's own execution paths (ordered, batched, parallel and empty) with the `gsheet_write` callback set, swapping only the callbacks that call the Sheets API for stubs that record the rows. A callback the engine requires but the copy function leaves unset fails here, without credentials or network access:

```sh
make test_copy_function
```

### Auth factory tests

`test/integration/test_auth_factory.cpp` creates real `gsheet` secrets and builds the auth provider from them with `CreateAuthFromSecret`, with a mock standing in for Google's token endpoint. It checks, for example, that a secret given a `REFRESH_TOKEN` fails with an error when that token is revoked instead of starting the browser login. No credentials or network access needed:

```sh
make test_auth_factory
```

### SQL tests

SQL tests run against the real Google Sheets API and require credentials. There are two ways to run them:

**Option 1: With an access token**

If you already have a Google Sheets API access token:

```sh
TOKEN=your-token-here make test
```

**Option 2: With a service account key file**

If you have a service account JSON key file, the test script will generate a token and set up both `TOKEN` and `KEY_FILE_PATH` for you:

```sh
./scripts/test_sql.sh path/to/keyfile.json
```

This script will:
1. Set up a Python venv and install dependencies
2. Generate an access token from the key file
3. Set `TOKEN` and `KEY_FILE_PATH` environment variables
4. Run `make test` (builds DuckDB + extension, then runs SQL logic tests)

To obtain a key file, create a Google Cloud service account with access to the test spreadsheets and download its JSON key. See [Google's documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete) for details.

## CI Pipeline

The CI pipeline gates builds behind tests:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[push / pull_request] --> B[Unit Tests]
    B --> C[SQL Tests]
    B --> F[OAuth Listener Tests]
    C --> D[Build next]
    C --> E[Build stable]
    F --> D
    F --> E
```

- **Unit tests** — always run, no credentials needed
- **OAuth listener tests** — always run in parallel with SQL tests, no credentials needed (builds the full extension - see `make test_oauth_listener`); the same job runs the COPY TO tests (`make test_copy_function`) and the auth factory tests (`make test_auth_factory`)
- **SQL tests** — require `GSHEETS_KEY_FILE_JSON` repo secret; skip gracefully on fork PRs without credentials
- **Distribution builds** — only start after all test stages pass

For fork PRs, maintainers can manually trigger SQL tests via **Actions → SQL Tests → Run workflow**.

## Releasing

Pushing a `v*` tag runs `.github/workflows/Release.yml`:

1. Builds the extension for every platform against the DuckDB release named in `duckdb_version` (wasm is excluded). This must be a release tag such as `v2.0.0`, not a branch: branch builds are stamped with a dev version that released DuckDB clients refuse to load.
2. Signs each binary with `scripts/sign_extension.sh`, verifies the signature against `scripts/extension_signing_public_key.pem`, and attaches the gzipped binaries to the GitHub release.
3. Triggers `deploy_docs.yml` on `main`, which downloads the binaries from all non-draft, non-prerelease releases and lays them out under `/extensions` with `scripts/build_extension_repo.py`, next to the docs.

The site then serves a DuckDB extension repository at `https://ebardelli.github.io/duckdb_gsheets/extensions`:

```
.well-known/duckdb-extension-repo.json                        signing public keys
<duckdb_version>/<platform>/gsheets.duckdb_extension.gz         newest release
gsheets/<tag>/<duckdb_version>/<platform>/gsheets.duckdb_extension.gz   last 3 releases
```

Only the last three releases get versioned copies, because a Pages site is limited to 1 GB.

### Signing key

The private key is the `DUCKDB_EXTENSION_SIGNING_PK` repository secret: a 2048-bit RSA key in PEM format. The matching public key is committed as `scripts/extension_signing_public_key.pem`. To rotate keys, add the new public key to `.well-known` (pass a second `--public-key` to `build_extension_repo.py`) before switching the secret, so existing users can re-create the repository and trust both keys during the switch.

## Installing deployed binaries

DuckDB must be launched with `allow_unsigned_extensions` set to true:

CLI:
```shell
duckdb -unsigned
```

Python:
```python
con = duckdb.connect(':memory:', config={'allow_unsigned_extensions' : 'true'})
```

NodeJS:
```js
db = new duckdb.Database(':memory:', {"allow_unsigned_extensions": "true"});
```

Set the repository endpoint to your bucket:

```sql
SET custom_extension_repository='bucket.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/<your_extension_name>/latest';
```

Then install and load:

```sql
INSTALL gsheets
LOAD gsheets
```

## Formatting

- Install clang-format (e.g. `brew install clang-format`)
- Install cmake-format (e.g. `pip install cmake-format`)

```sh
$ clang-format --version
clang-format version 20.1.8
```

```sh
$ cmake-format --version
0.6.13
```

```sh
make format
```
