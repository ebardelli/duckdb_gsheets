// authorization-code + PKCE login - including reopening the browser - and
// return the new tokens (the same OAuthTokenResponse shape a plain refresh
// returns - refresh_token must be set), or throw. Left unset (nullptr) for
// callers that can't or don't want to reauthenticate automatically, in which
// case invalid_grant just surfaces as an OAuthInvalidGrantException like any
// other refresh failure.
//
// Only ever wire this up for an OAuthAuth instance whose GetAuthorizationHeader
// is exclusively called from one thread at a time across its whole lifetime
// (e.g. built fresh per query bind, like ReadSheetBind does) - it typically
// blocks on interactive browser/stdin input for minutes, which is only
// acceptable on a thread that's allowed to block like that; a COPY sink
// thread running under PER_THREAD_OUTPUT is not, so CreateAuthFromSecret's
// `allow_interactive_reauth` must be false for that call site.
